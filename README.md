## üåç Empowering Change: Rewarding Eco-Friendly Actions with $EFRND Tokens üå±

## Overview

This Solution Build on [Taiko Blockchain](https://taiko.xyz). At EarthFriends, we reward users for eco-friendly actions like planting trees, adopting sustainable practices, eco-friendly products, managing waste, or raising environmental awareness. Users simply upload proof of their activity, and after successful verification by Environment Auditors, they earn $EFRND tokens directly in their wallet that supports [Taiko Blockchain](https://taiko.xyz).

## Problem Solved

Environmental conservation often struggles with a lack of tangible incentives, discouraging individuals and communities from adopting eco-friendly habits. Traditional systems do not recognize or reward small yet impactful activities like planting trees, managing waste, or spreading awareness. This gap limits participation in environmental initiatives and slows down the collective effort to combat climate change.

## Solution

EarthFriends bridges this gap by creating a rewards-based system that incentivizes users to contribute to a greener planet through verified, tokenized recognition. 
We are utilizing [Taiko Blockchain](https://taiko.xyz) for this solution as it promot sustainability and carbon nutrility. We have deployed Auditor and ERC20 Token contract on [Taiko Blockchain](https://taiko.xyz).
If User do any activity like waste managment, planting tree, awareness campaign etc, he just simply upload the photos of the activity as proof and create an token transaction. On the Other side admin will review and verify the activity and approve the token transaction and mint the $EFRND token to user's wallet.
